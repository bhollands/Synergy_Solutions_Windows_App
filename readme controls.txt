How to control the C# program with only a keyboard

shift+L for lanuage select
shift+K for a 'serial command to be recieved'
1	 from letter up (Works from A onwards(sorry))
2	letter down (_,A,B,C)
3	change letter colum and then submit name and score (seems to be sticky for submition)

Scores are held in the score.txt file in  \Synergy_Solutions_App\bin\Debug
